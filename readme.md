Use GitHub [issue tracker](https://github.com/sachinchoolur/lg-autoplay.js/issues/new) in the event that you have come across a bug or glitch. It would also be very helpful if you could add a jsFiddle, which would allow you to demonstrate the problem in question.

Use [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=lightgallery) instead of github issue tracker if you need any help with implementing lightgallery in your project or if you have any personal support requests.
